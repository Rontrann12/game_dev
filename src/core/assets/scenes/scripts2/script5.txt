Letter:
    "Ronald Tran"
    "Since you have turned 25 yesterday,"
    "The state had assigned you a SO"
    "You must come to the capital building tomorrow at 10 am"
    "The state has excused you from work and your team had been notified"

Ron:
    "The hell?"
    "I"m 25 years old already?"
    "I didn"t event realize"
    "Manadatory SO assignment felt like a surprise to me"
    "Theres not much I can do about it now"
    "..."
    "I should shower"
    'Something fell out of my pocket as I took off my jacket'
    "What's this?"

Letter:
    "Hey Ron, It's Carmen"
    "I had fun earlier and I would like to see you again"
    "If you're interested too, then meet me in the alley behind the bar we met"
    "Same time, 3 days from today"
    "It'll be... a date if you will ;)"
    "I hope to see you again soon"

Ron:
    "I knew she was up to something from the start"
    "Is she serious about this!?"
    "Is this a trap?"
