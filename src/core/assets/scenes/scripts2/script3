    "I grab a coffee and arrived at my desk just in time"
    "I see that others from my team had just arrived as well"

    "From the corner of my eye, I see someone from management approach"

Shaina: Shaina_smile

Management:
    "Team, meet Shaina"
    "She just completed state training in Nuclear Engineering and will be working with you all starting today"

Ron:
    'Huh...' 
    'She's kind of cute'
    'Looks like now i'll have her pretty face to look forward to when I go to work now'
    'At least will make working for the rest of my life easier'

Team:
    "Welcome to the Team Shaina"

Ron:
    "Welcome to the Team Shaina"

Shaina: Shaina_wink_talking
    "Thank you!"
    "I look forward to working with you all"

Ron:
    'Shaina takes an empty desk next to me'
    "Hi, I'm Ron. I've been on this team for only about a year"
    "But let me know if you're ever stuck on something. I'd be happy to help"

Shaina: Shaina_smile_talking
    "Hi Ron, nice to meet you"
    "Thanks, I will keep that in mind"
    "..."

Shaina: Shaina_neutral_talking

    "So what does the team do?"

Shaina: Shaina_neutral

Ron:
    "So this team is called the NRCC.. Nuclear Reactor Control Center"
    "Basically, We develop Reactor components and maintain Calgary's nuclear energy systems"
    'I go through more of the details of what the team does'
    "Yup, so thats what we do"

Shaina: Shaina_sad_talking
    "Oh I see"

Ron:
    'Shaina doesn't seem too enthusiasic'
    'Either she isn't interested or I don't sound very interested myself'
    'I guess it can't be helped as we are practically told what to study and what to do for work'
    "Anyways, You should introduce yourself to Dale there"
    "He's the most experience member of the team and he can help you get set up"

Shaina: Shaina_smile_talking
    "Sure thanks!"
    "Nice talking to you Ron"
    "I will catch up with you later"

Ron:

    "aaand done! This calls for a quick celebration"
    "It"s almost time to go home"
    "I think I will stop by a nearby bar for a drink after work"
